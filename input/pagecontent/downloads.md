### NPM Package and Definitions

The following file contains all the value sets, profiles, extensions, list of pages, and URLs in the IG, etc. defined as part of this Implementation Guide:

- [NPM Package](package.tgz)

In addition, there are format-specific definition files:

- [XML](definitions.xml.zip)
- [JSON](definitions.json.zip)
- [TTL](definitions.ttl.zip)

These files should be the preferred source when generating implementation artifacts since they contain all of the rules about what makes these profiles valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the specification and profiles that apply in order to make a conformant implementation.  See the overview on [validating FHIR profiles and resources]({{ site.data.fhir.path }}validation.html).

[r4-init]
There are also specific packages for the R4 and R4B FHIR releases:

#### R4-specific NPM Package and Definitions

- [R4 NPM Package](package.r4.tgz)

#### R4B-specific NPM Package and Definitions

- [R4B NPM Package](package.r4b.tgz)

[r4-end]
[r5-init]
There is also a specific package for the R5 FHIR specifications:

#### R5-specific NPM Package and Definitions
